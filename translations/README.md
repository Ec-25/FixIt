# Contributions of translations
If you wish, you can contribute with the translation of fixit into your language, for this you must follow the convention used, the folder must contain the selected language as its name, and each file must end in each language to be able to differentiate them, for example: _es (for Spanish ).

Inside it must contain only those files that contain translatable texts. You can take as a base and example the files in Spanish that are the first to receive updates.

### All contributions to the tool are appreciated!.
